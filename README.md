# itinerari
itinerari is a travel management web application that allows users to create a single-page itinerary to organize and plan their travel logistics. Itineraries are fully customizable for a single traveler, or for small or large groups. The user begins by creating an itinerary for an upcoming trip and gathering flight information through intuitive forms (car rental, and hotel coming soon!). Logged in users are able to add and edit general features on their itinerary. Logged in users are able to add multiple flights to a single itinerary making this application perfect for complicated group travel with many moving parts. itinerari hopes travelers can benefit from having their travel information conveniently all in one place, or to help with communication within a group of travelers.
